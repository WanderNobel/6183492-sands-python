# Signal Generator Project

A simple Python project for generating and visualizing signals.

## Generated Signals 

This projects generates and plots the following singals:
- A sinusoidal signal
- A step function
- A time-shifted sinusoidal signal
- A time-shifted and time-scaled sinusoidal signal

## How to run

To run the project, you need to have Python installed. Then you can run the following command:

```bash
python run.py
```
The four different signals will be plotted with time on the x-axis and amplitude on the y-axis.
